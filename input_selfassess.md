Hi @channel,

to sharpen the focus of the introductory DL presentation (04/07/18), I would like to ask you to rate couple of topics on the scale 0-5 according to how familiar are you with them. For example rating 0 means roughly "I may have heard about it sometimes in the past or may not, in any case, I could not explain it to anybody, not even myself" and 5 means roughly "I am very comfortable with the topic and I could explain it to the rest of the team."

You will find the sheet with the topics under [following link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hE_g6Gkc24SrI6MQJYtAI3StxmxSjt5C8---kgHgK5Y/edit?usp=sharing). If editing does not work for you (e.g. you need to create account), you will find the same document also in `it/tehcclub/2018_07_17_mh_dl_intro/input_assses.csv`. Please keep it (somewhat) anonymous.

Thanks a lot!
